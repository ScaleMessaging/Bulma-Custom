# Bulma-Custom
Adding custom namespace for Bulma so that it will not conflict with other CSS frameworks.

# What is and Why Bulma
Bulma is a CSS framework that does not ship JS functionality so it means it is light and flexible.
Sometimes, we might need a quick component so instead of creating from scratch (Select dropdowns, buttons, etc) it is ideal if we will use Bulma.
We will not use Bulma all the time but when it is just really necessary. This package compliments the internal tool we are building in SM.

# Latest
